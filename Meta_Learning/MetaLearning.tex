\section{What are the references about?}
These references are all about papers on meta learning. First we will list some papers that look at meta learning and contrastive learning:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \cite{ni2021close}: Show that meta-learning and contrastive learning can be set up in ways where tehy are equivelant or very similar to each other.
  \item \cite{li2022metaug}: Uses meta-learning to learn augmentation generator for contrastive learning.
\end{itemize}

Now we will look at some papers that look at meta learning and continual learning:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \cite{vuorio2018meta}: Uses meta-learning to control update step to prevent CF.
  \item \cite{gupta2020look}: Uses meta-learning to learn per-parameter learning rates to prevent CF.
  \item \cite{von2021learning}: Similarly to \cite{gupta2020look} uses meta-learning to learn per-parameter learning rates to prevent CF, put promotes sparse gradients while doing so. 
\end{itemize}
